# Programming and Scripting

by Joanna Mnich

# 1. Introduction

This project is part of the Programming and Scripting coursework.
The objective is to apply programming techniques and basic machine learning methods to solve a real-world classification problem.
It covers fundamental concepts such as data collection, cleansing, visualization, and interpretation.
The project investigates statistical approaches, data collection methods, and fundamental machine learning algorithms for extracting useful information from data

# 2. Iris Data



The simplicity and structure of the Iris dataset made it an ideal starting point for understanding fundamental Programming and Scripting.
