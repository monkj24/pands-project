# Programming and Scripting

by Joanna Mnich

# 1. Introduction

The Iris dataset was used as a foundational example to apply core data analytics techniques, such as data visualization, statistical analysis, and classification.
Iris species were classified using supervised learning methods such as logistic regression and decision trees based on sepal and petal dimensions.
Pairplots and boxplots were used to visually examine relationships between flower measurements and species, helping to identify patterns and correlations.
Using the Iris dataset allowed us to implement the full data analysis workflowâ€”from data exploration and visualization to model building and evaluation.

The simplicity and structure of the Iris dataset made it an ideal starting point for understanding fundamental Programming and Scripting.
