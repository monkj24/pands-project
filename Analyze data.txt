Column names were created because the dataset does not have a header row.

Used code print(df.head) doesn't show the full data, only 4 rows. I have to add 150 to the code print(df.head(150))
to show me the first 4 rows and a few last ones.# https://chatgpt.com/c/68163a89-4bb4-800b-a7d9-6f6f51f210d6

To make a histogram, I need the mean and standard deviation calculations. I created  a section, Maths calculation, and calculated the mean, minimum, max, median, and standard deviation.
